## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
pad.simple is a lightweight notepad system that contains a barebones notepad system with additional
tools note included with traditional notepads. In addition, the system will be built in order to 
accommodate for expansions and additions depending on the needs of the user. The system will also
include profiles so that the system can adapt to multiple needs as well. If a user requires that
pad.simple be utilized for programming purposes with specific addons/mods, they can specify a profile
be utilized as a startup for a particular item for said coding extension. Likewise the needs for a simple
text file doesn't need near as much and the simple base system may be enough. The idea behind pad.simple
is just what it says, to keep the notepad system as simple as possible as per the need of the user.

I have hopes of making this system cross platform, but the initial platform will be a Windows platform.

####Additional notes: 
I am writing this system as a learning tool. I have been programming for many years but have wanted to learn
Python. Please excuse any errors that you may find as this is a project of learning for me first and foremost.
If this project gains any noteriety (as I doubt it will) then at that time I may consider taking on additional
team members to increase productivity and effectiveness. I also realize there are other projects that are 
similar to this one, which is why I stress that this is an EDUCATIONAL project that I really hope to utilize
for my own use more than anything and share here just for the purposes of learning Git as well.

## <a name="user-guide"></a>User Guide
A link to a Wiki will eventually be placed here upon completion of the first build.

## <a name="addons"></a>Addon/Mod Guide
To be written at a future time. All Mods and Addons will be written off of the base system and 
will act as children to that base in naming convention. This will be elaborated more upon
completion of the first build.
